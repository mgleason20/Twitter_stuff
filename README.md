# Twitter_stuff

#The twitter_intro.Rmd file provides a compilation of code gathered from the cran-project.org, github, youtube, etc. I attempted to summarize the research I did on the basics related to rtweet. Hopefully this streamlines learning how to use the rtweet package. 

#The second file Twitter_hashtags_users.Rmd discusses how to search for the top tweeters of a hashtag, narrow the scope of that search, organize the users and look into their profile (followers, friends, verification, tenure). Lastly I experiment with a network analysis (originally shared by Michael Kearney).
